# Pretty Basic Pagination (PBP)

A JavaScript module designed to provide book-style pagination for large
content (books, articles) on a Web page. The module is designed to be
stand-alone (it does not use any framework like jQuery or Bootstrap)
and be—as much as possible—plug-and-play.

In order to use PBP on a website, the website will need to provide the
_framework_ in which to display the content (this includes navigational
functions, like going to previous or next pages), all the _styling_ for
the content, as well as JavaScript functions to support the various
features.

As much as PBP is “basic,” it is not for the faint-of-heart. A fair amount
of basic web design knowledge is needed to implement it successfully.
At a minimum, understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies is
expected.

## Getting Started

To get started, please review the
[Getting Started](documentation/getting-started.md) guide, which will help you
with step-by-step instructions on how to incorporate PBP into your own
project. The [Reference](documentation/reference.md) guide provides in-depth
documentation of the functions and features of PBP.

If you want to delve into the PBP module itself, and possibly change and
adapt it for your use, you want to start with the
[Design](documentation/design.md) page. This page will explain how the
PBP module is laid out and what tools are available to test out any
changes made to the module.

## Warranty

PBP is not intended to be incorporated as part of a framework like
WordPress. You are welcome to try and incorporate it in any existing
framework you like, but no guarantees that will work.
